# google-homepage
Tnis is my first Odin project. I have been on this journey of mastering web development skills for sometimes now.
Even though I haven't mastered it yet, I am hopeful that I will be an expert in it soon.
Some of the code you will find here are for tesing purposes. Don't use them in a production enviroment.
One of the first projects that I have been asked to work on is a google homepage.
